Use your chrome-devtools MCP tools to:

1. Navigate to chrome://extensions
2. Take a screenshot and save it as /Users/ali/GHOST/extensions-page.png
3. Tell me what you see - is "AssistMD Ghost Overlay (MVP)" listed?
4. If listed, are there any error badges?
5. If NOT listed, that confirms --load-extension isn't working

Then investigate why by:

6. Check if Developer mode is actually enabled (look for the toggle in the screenshot)
7. If Developer mode is OFF, try to enable it by evaluating JavaScript:
   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('extensions-manager').shadowRoot.querySelector('extensions-toolbar').shadowRoot.querySelector('#devMode').click()
   ```
8. Take another screenshot after clicking
9. See if the extension appears

Report all findings with the screenshots attached.
