# AssistMD Ghost Overlay v0.0.2

## Objectives
- Replace the hard-coded `DEMO` text with note content supplied by a side panel or temporary input surface.
- Add an undo flow (Alt+Z) that restores the captured value from `readValue(el)` prior to the Alt+Enter paste operation.
- Restrict `host_permissions` to the specific EMR domain(s) used in production instead of `<all_urls>`.
